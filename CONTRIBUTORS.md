General format is: contributor, github handle, email. In some cases, the
contributor field is an organization instead of an actual person---this is for
cases where the work was done on behalf of the organization, ie as part of
their job. In others, no contributor field and/or email is shown---this is
because this list was partially (mostly) reconstructed from github commit
information and the person's real life name and email are unknown.

Listed in no particular order:
